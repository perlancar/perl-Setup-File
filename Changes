        - Remove use of autodie to avoid failure reports [CT].


0.18    2014-05-02  Released-By: SHARYANTO

        - No functional changes.

        - Make tests pass again by requiring fixed Perinci::Tx::Manager 0.49.


0.17    2012-09-04  Released-By: SHARYANTO

        - Adjust to Rinci 1.1.29 and Perinci::Tx::Manager 0.40 (descriptive
          check_state result message and dry-run message).


0.16    2012-08-31  Released-By: SHARYANTO

        - mkfile() creates file with mode 0644 instead of default umask. mkdir()
          creates dir with mode 0755 instead of default umask. This is more
          predictable and uniform across systems.


0.15    2012-08-29  Released-By: SHARYANTO

        [ENHANCEMENTS]

        - Update to Rinci 1.1.28 (transaction protocol v=2).

        - Add various simpler functions like rmdir(), mkdir(), rmfile(),
          mkfile(), chown(), chmod() (not exported).

        [INCOMPATIBLE CHANGES]

        - Move setup_dir() from Setup::File::Dir to Setup::File (I'm too lazy to
          put fully-qualified function names to the actions).


0.14    2012-03-28  Released-By: SHARYANTO

        - No functional changes. Split specification to Setup dist. Split
          Test::Setup to its own dist.


0.13    2012-03-28  Released-By: SHARYANTO

        - Refactor: create Test::Setup to reduce repetition when testing setup
          functions (testing dry-run, do, undo, redo, ...). Convert all test
          files to use this.

        - Robustness: step create: don't bail if file with the same content
          already exists.

        - Fix a couple of other bugs caught by Test::Setup.

        - build: Replace PodWeaver SubSpec plugin with Perinci.


0.12    2012-03-02  Released-By: SHARYANTO

        - No functional changes. Change references to Sub::Spec now to Rinci.


0.11    2012-01-26  Released-By: SHARYANTO

        - A small fix: make it clear that gen_content_code and
          check_content_code work with *reference* to content (but
          gen_content_code is also allowed to return the actual content
          [undocumented], for flexibility).


0.10    2011-12-29  Released-By: SHARYANTO
